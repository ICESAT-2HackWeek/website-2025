# What to Expect 

Our hackweeks focus on applied, hands-on learning, with participants engaging in
extended periods of small-group work. Our tutorials are designed to offer a 
broad snapshot of data science tools to support your applied investigations. 
Due to the relatively short duration of our events, we are not able to provide 
comprehensive, in-depth training in fundamental tools. Rather, our goal is to 
inform you about the types of tools we think are best suited to working with 
your datasets, leaving details of implementation to be supported through 
peer-learning and office hours.

In this hackweek we will focus on software development in support
of the ICESat-2 mission. We'll center most of our work on streamlining
data access patterns within the NASA earthaccess library. Our goal is to 
make it easier for people to access ICESat-2 data and make informed decisions
on which product, and which software solution, best supports their reserach 
needs. We will also think about how to integrate data across multiple 
(especially NISAR, but also GEDI, SnowEx, etc.).

Due to the invitational nature of this particular hackweek, and the well-defined
set of tasks, we will be focusing most activity on project work. There will 
be a few short tutorials offered by colleagues from the UW Scientific Software
Engineering Center.  

## Prerequisites

All tutorials and project work will assume participants are familiar with 
Python-based computing in the geosciences as described on the 
[Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) 
website.
