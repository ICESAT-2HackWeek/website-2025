In a departure from recent hackweek years in larger venues, we're returning to the 
WRF Data Science Studio. For the style of event this year; a smaller gathering of 
invitation only peers, the data studio is a great environment for smaller teams.

```{Note}
More information about first day check-in will be updated here before the event and 
communicated via [ICESAT-2 Slack](https://icesat2hackweek.slack.com/).
```
