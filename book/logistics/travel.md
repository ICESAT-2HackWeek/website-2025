# Travel & Accommodation

```{Important}
The information outline below is for attendees who have registered for the event
before the June 20 deadline. If you are reading this after June 20 and have not 
[completed the registration form](https://uwashington.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bpSBPdrxFF2XkKG),

## Travel Support
```{Important}
All attendees travelling from outside the Seattle area are required to 
purchase their own flights. 

Attendees flying to Seattle for the duration of the event are entitled to 
receive travel funding support to offset or cover the expense of a 
return trip plane ticket. Please refer to 
[this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8qpIsUf-l6GNiCsit3HS2_lTsKkl-YbqTcYsLP8N0s/edit?tab=t.0) 
outlining the process for reimbursement and the amount of funds available. 

Note: to gain access to the Google Doc above use the email address used during 
the event registration process.
```

It can be challenging for UW to reimburse flights purchased through aggregators 
like Expedia, Kayak, etc., due to the way they generate itineraries. We advise 
booking directly through the airline you're seeking to fly with. 

Also, it is important to provide comparable travel fare information (ie. to 
compare with travel costs in the August 17-23 timeframe) during the 
reimbursement process if traveling to Seattle before August 17, 2025 or 
departing from August 23, 2025. This timeframe is considered personal time.

If in doubt or if you have any questions, reach out to 
[Mark Welden-Smith](mailto:escience-hackweeks@uw.edu) or DM via 
[ICESAT-2 Slack](https://icesat2hackweek.slack.com/).

## Arriving in Seattle FAQ

**What is the best way to get to campus from X location?**

The best answer will depend on your travel preferences. We suggest looking at
[this campus resource](https://www.washington.edu/visit/getting-to-campus/#:~:text=By%20bus%3A%20There%20are%20more,stop%20to%20the%20Visitor%20Center.).

**Can I park on campus during my time in Seattle?**

The short answer is yes, but not for free and we cannot reimburse parking 
expenses. The cheapest lot is E18 and it uses the [paybyphone app](https://transportation.uw.edu/park/visitor/pay-by-phone-parking) 
(or you can call the number on the pay station). Rates may change between now 
and the event, so be sure to [check this resource](https://transportation.uw.edu/maps/self-serve-parking) 
for the most up to date information. Parking is abundant at this location with 
the lot designed to take stadium level traffic during Husky games.

The map below shows the walking paths between lot 
[E18 and Physics/Astronomy Tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/b5mAiJdCFj8MmtSp9). 
Note that the suggested path through the middle of campus includes very 
steep stairs. Take the lower route near Husky Stadium for an easier, more 
level travel option. 

If you wish to park closer to the Alder Hall dorms, please refer to the 
information on the [transportation website](https://transportation.uw.edu/park/visitor/self-serve). 
The closest lots to the Alder Hall dorms 
are [W41, W10, and W27](https://transportation.uw.edu/maps/self-serve-parking). 
The closest lot to the Physics/Astronomy Tower is lot 
[W27](https://transportation.uw.edu/maps/self-serve-parking).

 **Is the the University District next to the eScience Institute area safe?**

As with any major US metropolitan city, people should be mindful of the 
environment they are moving through as a pedestrian. The University District 
may have a reduced amount of student pedestrians due to the time of year and 
depending on the time of day. If you are at all concerned about your safety 
coming to and from the hackweek venue, reach out to 
[mweldens@uw.edu](mailto:escience-hackweeks@uw.edu). We can facilitate travel 
buddy arrangements in groups through Slack for those staying in the same area. 
We also suggest looking at this 
[campus safety website for additional resources](https://www.washington.edu/safety/alert/).
