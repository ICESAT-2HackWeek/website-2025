about:
  description: The title of  
   this year's event is “Streamlining and expanding ICESat-2 
   tooling and workflows across libraries and missions”. The focus will be on 
   streamlining (via hacking/project work) the current ecosystem of ICESat-2 
   tooling and creating a vision (and maybe some prototypes!) for how that 
   ecosystem can evolve and expand to include more missions and tools 
   (especially NISAR, but also GEDI, SnowEx, etc.).
