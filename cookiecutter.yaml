about:
  description: In this hackweek we will focus on software development in support
   of the ICESat-2 mission. We'll center most of our work on streamlining
   data access patterns within the NASA earthaccess library. Our goal is to 
   make it easier for people to access ICESat-2 data and make informed decisions
   on which product, and which software solution, best supports their reserach 
   needs. We will also think about how to integrate data across multiple 
   (especially NISAR, but also GEDI, SnowEx, etc.).
